### Musi

### What and why?

Musi is an app where users can rank their favorite songs, create personal lists, and share their music taste with others. Current music platforms make it easy to listen but not to express how much you like a song or compare preferences. By allowing users to share ranked lists and compare profiles with friends, Musi makes music more social and helps people discover new songs through each other.

### For whom?

Our target users are college students and young adults who regularly listen to music and enjoy sharing recommendations with friends. This group is highly engaged with music and social apps, making them ideal early adopters.

### How?

Musi will include features inspired by Beli:

- Search for songs through a music database API.

- Rank songs using relative ranking (drag-and-drop or ordering).

- Profile page showcasing personal lists.

- Social features to follow friends and compare music tastes.

- Discovery features such as trending songs and friend suggestions.

### Scope

The project is achievable for a team of 4â€“6 in one semester while still non-trivial. Key challenges include implementing relative ranking, building social interactions, and integrating algorithmic music discovery features. These features are doable but require a team to make it robust.
